# POSM: PHP-Only Site Management

POSM is my vision of what content management software should be. Web designers build beautiful templates for
software like WordPress, only to have to customize (and often minimize) portions of the back end, create alternate
stylesheets for content editors, and in many cases, even write a usage guide for helping the non-technical owner
of the website to be able to change anything down the road, when they will surely forget anything you show them.

Everything should be simple, transparent, and straightforward. The following features attempt to apply that:

## You got back end on my front end

The only thing that shouldn't be obvious is how to log in to the websiteâ€”if users can't log in, a link shouldn't
be visible. Everything else is clear once logged in; the back end works right on top of the front end.

There are options to add pages, manage existing pages, edit the current page, and manage site-wide settings. Other than
that, and a logout button, there isn't much else to POSM. And there needn't be. The back end is as easy to navigate
as the website that you design, and the site's owner will have no problem finding the right page to edit.

## No database?

The owner of the website shouldn't have their content tied to a database just for ease of editing. With POSM, the
content is kept in the installation directory, so POSM can be moved around from server to server without needing to
migrate database tables.

It also means that you can edit the files yourself, if you prefer to use a different code editor. Just edit the
file in place as you would edit a static HTML file.

## Damn easy templating

Writing templates for most themable websites isn't that hard, but I thought I could make it even easier. Writing a
template for POSM is dead simple, and I plan to write an API reference so that all functions that are available for
calling in a template are well-documented and easy to access. Until then, see an existing template for examples
of how easy it is to create a POSM site.

## Inline content editing

There should be no Edit page, that pulls you away from the content you are writing and drops you in a textarea that,
no matter how well it attempts to, can never identically parallel what the published content will look like. This
also adds another layer of maintenance, as editor styles can easily become out of sync.

With POSM, the page content itself is made editable using the `contenteditable` HTML5 attribute. Changes made to
the page content are reflected on save, and what you see is EXACTLY what you get. So far it's an extremely simple
editor, but it's great. There's also an option to toggle the page code editor, for cases where someone may want to
manually tweak the HTML output of the visual editor, or maybe just paste in code for some embeddable content.
